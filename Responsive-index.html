      <p>Hello my name is Jose Morales. I was born in Xela, Guatemala. I came here to Texas when I was just 4 years old. And I have been living here ever since. Last year I went to Guatemala to visit my family.</p>

      <p> The only sport that I watch is football. And no I am not talking about American football. I am talking about what is known here as "soccer". I started watching football when I was 6 years old. My favorite team is Tottenham Hotspur. They are a team from London, England.</p>

      <p>When I am older the I would like to go visit England and Italy. The main reason that I wouold like to go to Engalnd is because I would love to go watch my team play.</p>
